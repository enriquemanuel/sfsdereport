# SF-SDE-REPORT
This was made from the basic Flask quickstart from Openshift @ https://github.com/ryanj/flask-base.git

# Goal for this
To create a report that runs on a daily basis to provide an email after scraping SF
The way it was executed was from another server doing a curl to the correct path
in this example it would be http://<url>/dailyreport
